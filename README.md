LogSleep
----
My Python application, named 'logsleep,' creates a table and visualizes your sleep patterns when you input your sleep durations. 
It operates through the command line (cmd) and keeps a record of the sleep logs. The application is designed to help users understand and regulate their sleep habits

For proper functionality, specify the location of the "mydatabase.db" file in the 'mydatabase.db' section
